	abstract = {Given two polygonal curves in the plane, there are many ways to deﬁne a notion of similarity between them. One popular measure is the Fr´echet distance. Since it was proposed by Alt and Godau in 1992, many variants and extensions have been studied. Nonetheless, even more than 20 years later, the original O(n2 log n) algorithm by Alt and Godau for computing the Fr´echet distance remains the state of the art (here, n denotes the number of edges on each curve). This has led Helmut Alt to conjecture that the associated decision problem is 3SUM-hard.},

	abstract = {The Fr´echet distance between two curves in a metric space is a measure of the similarity between the curves. We present a discrete variation of this measure. It provides good approximations of the continuous measure and can be eﬃciently computed using a simple algorithm. We also consider variants of discrete Fr´echet distance, and ﬁnd an interesting connection to measuring distance between theories.},
