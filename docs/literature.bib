	abstract = {Given two polygonal curves in the plane, there are many ways to deﬁne a notion of similarity between them. One popular measure is the Fr´echet distance. Since it was proposed by Alt and Godau in 1992, many variants and extensions have been studied. Nonetheless, even more than 20 years later, the original O(n2 log n) algorithm by Alt and Godau for computing the Fr´echet distance remains the state of the art (here, n denotes the number of edges on each curve). This has led Helmut Alt to conjecture that the associated decision problem is 3SUM-hard.},

The method mainly uses the linear accelerometer data of the mobile phone to obtain the three-dimensional spatial trajectory of the gesture action in the mobile phone coordinate system after preprocessing, and then extracts the time domain features of the trajectory, and then uses the F-S secondary authentication algorithm to identify and authenticate the gesture. The experimental results showed that the false rejection rate FRR of the F-S algorithm in the gesture recognition process is 4.13\%, and the false acceptance rate FAR is 1.26\%.},

No explicit reconstruction of the medial axis is conducted and only bisectors of pairs of primitives (i.e. vertex, edge, or face) are analytically constructed and intersected with the other mesh, yielding a set of conic segments. For each conic segment, the distance functions to all primitives are constructed and the maximum value of their low envelope function may correspond to a candidate point for the Hausdorff distance. The algorithm is fully implemented and several experimental results are also presented.},

	abstract = {With vehicle tracking data becoming an important sensor data resource for a range of applications related to traffic assessment and prediction, fast and accurate mapmatching algorithms become a necessary means to ultimately utilize this data. This work proposes a fast mapmatching algorithm which exploits tracking data error estimates in a provably correct way and offers a quality guarantee for the computed result trajectory. A new model for the map-matching task is introduced which takes tracking error estimates into account. The proposed Adaptive Clipping algorithm (i) provably solves this map-matching task and (ii) utilizes the weak Fr´echet distance to measure similarity between curves. The algorithm uses the error estimates in the trajectory data to reduce the search space (error-aware pruning), while offering the quality guarantee of finding a curve which minimizes the weak Fr´echet distance to the vehicle trajectory among all possible curves in the road network. Moreover, this work introduces an outputsensitive variant of an existing weak Fr´echet map-matching algorithm, which is also employed in the Adaptive Clipping algorithm. Output-sensitiveness paired with error-aware pruning makes Adaptive Clipping the first map-matching algorithm that provably solves a well-defined map-matching task. An experimental evaluation establishes further that Adaptive Clipping is also in a practical setting a fast algorithm that at the same time produces high-quality matching results.},

Finally, a decision is made to see if the test signature is genuine. A new definition of curve similarity is introduced in the algorithm and a new mathematical model of judging signature curve similarity has been built up on this definition. The algorithm implies shifting and stretching transformation of the signature curves. The experimental results show the efficiency and feasibility of this algorithm.},

More than 20 years later, the state of the art algorithms for most variants still take time more than O(n2/ log n), but no matching lower bounds are known, not even under reasonable complexity theoretic assumptions. To obtain a conditional lower bound, in this paper we assume the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis or, more precisely, that there is no O∗((2 − δ)N ) algorithm for CNF-SAT for any δ {\textgreater} 0. Under this assumption we show that the Fr´echet distance cannot be computed in strongly subquadratic time, i.e., in time O(n2−δ) for any δ {\textgreater} 0. This means that ﬁnding faster algorithms for the Fr´echet distance is as hard as ﬁnding faster CNF-SAT algorithms, and the existence of a strongly subquadratic algorithm can be considered unlikely.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11862},
	abstract = {In this paper we study a wide range of variants for computing the (discrete and continuous) Fréchet distance between uncertain curves. We deﬁne an uncertain curve as a sequence of uncertainty regions, where each region is a disk, a line segment, or a set of points. A realisation of a curve is a polyline connecting one point from each region. Given an uncertain curve and a second (certain or uncertain) curve, we seek to compute the lower and upper bound Fréchet distance, which are the minimum and maximum Fréchet distance for any realisations of the curves. We prove that both the upper and lower bound problems are NP-hard for the continuous Fréchet distance in several uncertainty models, and that the upper bound problem remains hard for the discrete Fréchet distance. In contrast, the lower bound (discrete [5] and continuous) Fréchet distance can be computed in polynomial time. Furthermore, we show that computing the expected discrete Fréchet distance is \#P-hard when the uncertainty regions are modelled as point sets or line segments. The construction also extends to show \#P-hardness for computing the continuous Fréchet distance when regions are modelled as point sets. On the positive side, we argue that in any constant dimension there is a FPTAS for the lower bound problem when ∆/δ is polynomially bounded, where δ is the Fréchet distance and ∆ bounds the diameter of the regions. We then argue there is a near-linear-time 3-approximation for the decision problem when the regions are convex and roughly δ-separated. Finally, we also study the setting with Sakoe–Chiba time bands, where we restrict the alignment between the two curves, and give polynomial-time algorithms for upper bound and expected discrete and continuous Fréchet distance for uncertainty regions modelled as point sets.},

	abstract = {The Fr{\textbackslash}'echet distance is a similarity measure between two curves \$A\$ and \$B\$: Informally, it is the minimum length of a leash required to connect a dog, constrained to be on \$A\$, and its owner, constrained to be on \$B\$, as they walk without backtracking along their respective curves from one endpoint to the other. The advantage of this measure on other measures such as the Hausdorff distance is that it takes into account the ordering of the points along the curves. The discrete Fr{\textbackslash}'echet distance replaces the dog and its owner by a pair of frogs that can only reside on \$n\$ and \$m\$ specific pebbles on the curves \$A\$ and \$B\$, respectively. These frogs hop from a pebble to the next without backtracking. The discrete Fr{\textbackslash}'echet distance can be computed by a rather straightforward quadratic dynamic programming algorithm. However, despite a considerable amount of work on this problem and its variations, there is no subquadratic algorithm known, even for approximation versions of the problem. In this paper we present a subquadratic algorithm for computing the discrete Fr{\textbackslash}'echet distance between two sequences of points in the plane, of respective lengths \$m{\textbackslash}le n\$. The algorithm runs in \$O({\textbackslash}dfrac\{mn{\textbackslash}log{\textbackslash}log n\}\{{\textbackslash}log n\})\$ time and uses \$O(n+m)\$ storage. Our approach uses the geometry of the problem in a subtle way to encode legal positions of the frogs as states of a finite automata.},

Our algorithm also yields a linear-time algorithm for maximum flow in a planar graph with the source and sink on the same face. For the case where negative edge-lengths are allowed, we give an algorithm requiringO(n4/3log(nL)) time, whereLis the absolute value of the most negative length. This algorithm can be used to obtain similar bounds for computing a feasible flow in a planar network, for finding a perfect matching in a planar bipartite graph, and for finding a maximum flow in a planar graph when the source and sink are not on the same face. We also give parallel and dynamic versions of these algorithms.},
