	abstract = {Given two polygonal curves in the plane, there are many ways to deﬁne a notion of similarity between them. One popular measure is the Fr´echet distance. Since it was proposed by Alt and Godau in 1992, many variants and extensions have been studied. Nonetheless, even more than 20 years later, the original O(n2 log n) algorithm by Alt and Godau for computing the Fr´echet distance remains the state of the art (here, n denotes the number of edges on each curve). This has led Helmut Alt to conjecture that the associated decision problem is 3SUM-hard.},

	abstract = {In order to further improve the accuracy of gesture authentication, based on the traditional Frechet distance and Support Vector Machine (SVM), this paper proposes a two-level authentication algorithm that combines space trajectory similarity and feature classification, which is called the F-S algorithm. The method mainly uses the linear accelerometer data of the mobile phone to obtain the three-dimensional spatial trajectory of the gesture action in the mobile phone coordinate system after preprocessing, and then extracts the time domain features of the trajectory, and then uses the F-S secondary authentication algorithm to identify and authenticate the gesture. The experimental results showed that the false rejection rate FRR of the F-S algorithm in the gesture recognition process is 4.13\%, and the false acceptance rate FAR is 1.26\%.},

Based on the fact that communication using gestures is one of the primary methods of communication between people, this discipline has seen a lot of advancement. In this paper we present a comparative study of curve representation and similarity measurement algorithms with the purpose of using them for gesture detection and interpretation. Of special interest are algorithms that will be able to detect and track different types of gestures. Therefore, a thorough discussion of gesture classification has been an important part of this research.},

After capturing 2D positions of a person's joints and skeleton wireframe of the body, the system computed the equation of motion trajectory for every joint. Similarity metric was defined as distance between motion trajectories of standard and real-time videos. A modifiable scoring formula was used for simulating the gesture grading scenario. Experimental results showed that the system worked efficiently with high real-time performance, low cost of equipment and strong robustness to the interference of noise.},

It has been designed as a highly general tool, and it does no assumption on the particular approach used to build the simplified representation. It returns both numerical results (meshes areas and volumes, maximum and mean error, etc.) and visual results, by coloring the input surface according to the approximation error.},

It is proved that the Hausdorff distance of any two polynomial-time computable curves is a left-Σ2P real number. Conversely, for any tally set A in Σ2P, there exist two polynomial-time computable curves such that set A is computable in polynomial time relative to the Hausdorff distance of these two curves. More generally, we show that, for any set A in Σ2P, there exist two polynomial-time computable curves such that set A is computable in polynomial time relative to the Hausdorff distances of subcurves of these two curves.},

The locus of candidate points, events where the Hausdorff distance may occur, is fully classified. These events include simple cases where foot points of vertices are examined as well as more complicated cases where extreme distance evaluation is needed on the intersection curve of one mesh with the medial axis of the other mesh. No explicit reconstruction of the medial axis is conducted and only bisectors of pairs of primitives (i.e. vertex, edge, or face) are analytically constructed and intersected with the other mesh, yielding a set of conic segments. For each conic segment, the distance functions to all primitives are constructed and the maximum value of their low envelope function may correspond to a candidate point for the Hausdorff distance. The algorithm is fully implemented and several experimental results are also presented.},
