\section*{Abstract}


\section{Introduction}
% motivation
At first it seems that measuring the similairty between two curves
is a very theoretical problem
but it has many, not that obvious, pratical applications.
It is used in Geo-Information-Systems (GIS) to 
quantify the similarity or quality of two maps, % cite
find patterns in vehicle traffic or animal tracking data 
by trajectory analysis, % cite
gesture recognition on touch devices like smartphones, % cite
and shape matching in the field of computer vision. 

To quantify the similairty of two given curves (e.g. shapes, paths, or trajectories)
a distance metric can be used. 
We can't simply use a distance metric like eucledian distance 
becuase we don't want to compare points to points 
but instead compare curves to curves. 

% two (polygonal) curves
% TODO: replace continous funcitons with other name
In the following we'll focus on polygonal curves (polygonal chains) 
instead of continuous functions ofen used in pure mathematics 
because most data we have for these problems is 
captured by some none continuous mechanisms, e.g., GPS positions from a tracking device.
Therefore we consider a polygonal curve $P$ to be definded as a 
sequence of points $p_1, \dots, p_n \in R^d$ where $d$ is the dimensionality 
of the space, e.g., $n=2$ or $n=3$, and linear interpolation between this points. 
However, many concepts also apply to continuous functions.


% Hausdorff distance
The commonly known \textit{Hausdorff distance} can be understood 
as the largest distance between any two points on the curves 
and is calculated by \autoref{eq_hausdorff_distance} \cite{alt_computing_1995}.

\begin{align}
  \label{eq_hausdorff_distance}
  \delta_{hd}(P,Q) = \max \left( \sup_{p \in P} \inf_{q \in Q} \text{dist}(p,q), \sup_{q \in Q} \inf_{p \in P} \text{dist}(p,q) \right)
\end{align}

However, this metric does not take the course of the curves into account. 
Two curves may have a small Hausdorff-distance but seem very dissimilar 
when looking at them, see \autoref{fig_hausdorff_distance_bad_example}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  % TODO: insert figure
  \caption[Hausdorff distance of two dissimilar curves]{The two shown curves are dissimilar (in a common sense) depsite having a small Hausdorff distance.}
  \label{fig_hausdorff_distance_bad_example}
\end{figure}

% continuous Fréchet distance equation

% Scope



% Fréchet distance Variants 
\section{Variants}
Through the years many slightly differnt variants of the continuous Fréchet distance have evolved. 
The continuous Fréchet distance takes into account every single point on the curves, 
with interpolation in the case of polygonal curves, 
without allowing to walk backwards 
and without any obstacles in between the two curves.

% TODO: Why allow it? Better algorithms?
The \textit{weak Fréchet distance} slightly modifies the continuous version by allowing 
going backwards. 

% TODO: Is that mapping bijective? Add sources
The \textit{discrete Fréchet distance} 
This gives an upper bound on the continuous Fréchet distance % Source?
and is often used as a approximation. % Source?
% discrete Fréchet distance and contrast to hausdorff distance

% (Geodesic Fréchet distance)

% (Homotopic Fréchet distance)
