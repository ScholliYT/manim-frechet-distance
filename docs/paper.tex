\section*{Abstract}


\section{Introduction}
% motivation
At first it seems that measuring the similairty between two curves
is a very theoretical problem
but it has many, not that obvious, pratical applications.
It is used in Geo-Information-Systems (GIS) to 
quantify the similarity or quality of two maps, % cite
find patterns in vehicle traffic or animal tracking data 
by trajectory analysis, % cite
gesture recognition on touch devices like smartphones \cite{hu_research_2022}, % cite
and shape matching in the field of computer vision. 

To quantify the similairty of two given curves (e.g. shapes, paths, or trajectories)
a distance metric can be used. 
We can't simply use a distance metric like eucledian distance 
becuase we don't want to compare points to points 
but instead compare curves to curves. 

% two (polygonal) curves
% TODO: replace continous funcitons with other name
\begin{mydef}
  \label{def_curve}
  We define a curve as a continuous function $f : [a,b] \mapsto V$ 
  with $a,b \in \mathbb{R}, a \leq b$ and $V$ being the space of the curve,
  e.g., $\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\mathbb{R}^3$.
\end{mydef}

\begin{mydef}
  \label{def_polygonal_curve}
  We define a polygonal curve (polygonal chain) 
  as a linearly interpolated curve 
  on $n \in \mathbb{N}$ points in $V$ such that
  $P : [0,n] \mapsto V$ 
  with  $P(i + \lambda) = (1 - \lambda)P(i) + \lambda P(i+1)$
  for all $\lambda \in [0,1]$ and all $i \in \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$.
\end{mydef}

In the following we will focus on polygonal curves (polygonal chains) 
instead of classical continuous curves, ofen used in pure mathematics, 
because most data we have in this area is 
captured by some none continuous mechanism, e.g., GPS positions from a tracking device.
Addionally, we focus on the 2D Space, i.e. $V = \mathbb{R}^2$.
However, many concepts also apply to normal curves and higher dimensional spaces.


% Hausdorff distance
The commonly known \textit{Hausdorff distance} can be understood 
as the largest distance between any two points on the curves. 
For each curve, a point with the maximum shortest distance to a point on the other curve is searched for, see \autoref{fig_hausdorff_distance_example}. \cite{alt_computing_1995}


\begin{mydef}
  \label{def_hausdorff_distance}
  Given two (polygonal) curves $P$ and $Q$, 
  their Hausdorff distance $\delta_{hd}(P,Q)$ is mathematically defined as: 
  $$\delta_{hd}(P,Q) = \max \left( \sup_{p \in P} \inf_{q \in Q} \text{dist}(p,q), \sup_{q \in Q} \inf_{p \in P} \text{dist}(p,q) \right)$$
\end{mydef}

This metric is very intuitive and can be easily computed for polygonal curves \cite{ko_complexity_2013}.
It finds applications in computer vision and computer graphics 
where it is used to compare the similarity of two mesh objects \cite{cignoni_metro_1998,ko_complexity_2013}. 
However, this metric does not take the course of the curves into account, 
but only the point sets of the individual curves.
Two curves may have a small Hausdorff-distance but seem very dissimilar 
when looking at them, see \autoref{fig_hausdorff_distance_bad_example}.

% Fréchet distance motivation
In reality, the course of the curves is important for many applications. 
For example, in handwriting character recognition on digital input devices, especially in Chinese, % TODO: add more citations
gesture recognition on smartphone touchscreens \cite{hu_research_2022}, % TODO: add more citations
and motion evaluation in real-time motion capturing \cite{qiao_real-time_2017, shehu_curve_2012}. % TODO: add more citations
For this reason, the \textit{Fréchet distance}, named after the famous french mathematician René Maurice Fréchet, was introduced.

A common analogy for the Fréchet distance can be shown by a man walking his dog. 
Assume that both the man and the dog are moving along a predefined fixed curve. 
Both are free to adjust their speed as they wish, even to stop. 
However, they are not allowed to go backwards. 
We are looking for the minimum length of the dog leash 
that is necessary for both of them to reach their destination. 
The length of the dog leash is then exactly the Fréchet distance of the two curves.

% continuous Fréchet distance equation

\begin{mydef}
  \label{def_frechet_distance}
  Given two (polygonal) curves $P: [a,a'] \mapsto V$, $Q: [b,b'] \mapsto V$ and a distance function $\text{dist}: (V,V) \mapsto \mathbb{R}$, 
  their Fréchet distance $\delta_{F}(P,Q)$ is mathematically defined as: 
  $$\delta_{F}(P,Q) = \inf_{\substack{\alpha: [0,1] \mapsto [a, a'] \\ \beta: [0,1] \mapsto [b, b']}} \max_{t \in [0,1]} \text{dist}(P(\alpha(t)), Q(\beta(t)))$$
  where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ represend the walking speed as 
  continuous monotonically increasing functions with
  $\alpha(0) = a, \alpha(1) = a'$, 
  $\beta(0) =b, \beta(1) =b'$.
\end{mydef}

% - Original Algorithm by Alt and Godau
% - Original Algorihm for discrete Fréchet distance
% - Newer Algorithms (vor variants)



% Fréchet distance Variants 
\section{Variants}
Through the years many slightly differnt variants of the continuous Fréchet distance (see Definition \ref{def_frechet_distance}) have evolved. 
The continuous Fréchet distance takes into account every single point on the curves, 
with interpolation in the case of polygonal curves, 
without allowing to walk backwards 
and without any obstacles in between the two curves.

% TODO: Why allow it? Better algorithms?
The \textit{weak Fréchet distance} slightly modifies the continuous version by allowing 
going backwards. 

% TODO: Is that mapping bijective? Add sources
The \textit{discrete Fréchet distance} 
This gives an upper bound on the continuous Fréchet distance % Source?
and is often used as a approximation. % Source?
% discrete Fréchet distance and contrast to hausdorff distance

% (Geodesic Fréchet distance)

% (Homotopic Fréchet distance)
